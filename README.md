# Vault-101

Welcome to the VAULT 

This is repo is meant to be a one-stop, countiniously updating resource center for all my coding needs. 

Includes (but not limited to...): 

- Basic computer setup (basically, a simple walkthrough of how to get your computer setup and ready to run various environments - just in case recovery isn't         possible)
- python 3 
- matplotlib
- excel/vba 
- mongoDB 
- Pandas (df manipulation)
- API guides and webscraping 
- sql and sqlalchemy 
- Javascript (updating...)
